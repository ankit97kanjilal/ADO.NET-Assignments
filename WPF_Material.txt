POrtion of LINQ
========================================
-First() --> returns first item from the result----List<Employee>   gives exception if no items in the result
-FirstOrDefault()-->returns first item from the result,does not give exception if no items in the result, it gives default value based on the data-type

-Single()-----> single record out of the result, should be used to convert the result into one record and if there are multiple items in the
result it will throw exception.

-SingleOrDefault()


WPF
==========================================================
WPF: Windows Presentation Foundation : used for developing Windows Application using declarative tags.
It is a vector-based graphical user-interface.
Winforms -----screen resolution which defines pixels on the screen for a point 

design app----> resolution of screen (r1)----------> different resolution (r2) 
		1000			500

--it is designed using tags based ---XAML-----> Xml Application Markup Language .cs .xaml
--better separation of UI and Logic of application
--Extensively supports 3D graphics and animations compared to winform
--Extensive Databinding features in WPF using xaml syntaxes.
--resources and styles defining and sharing can be done in WPF

==============Data binding in WPF====================
We can bind following objects:
1) a variable
2) an object
3) a collection
4) bind one WPF element with another element

Modes of binding
1) one-way
2) two-way
3) oneway to source
4) oneway to target
5) onetime

insert----DB
lstEmps=GetAllEmps
dgv.DataSource=lstEmps;//it was not happening automatically
so data binding is not happening here....

if dgv ---- binded with lstEmps then automatically DB will be updated
====================================================

WPF Resources:- These are the object which cab shared across elements, pages as a resources e.g. color, brush, variables, templates .
Every resource is created and referred using a resource id.
Resources can be shared at different scope levels:

1) Application level resources: accessible in any of the xaml pages. (Defined in App.xaml)
2) Page level resources:- accessible in any of the elements of the page in which resource is defined, not across pages.(Defined inside the window tag of the page.)
3) Element level reources:- This is limited to the element and its child elements

url: uniform resource location
uri: uniform resource identifier
urn: uniform resource name
